XUNIT TEST
--------------------------------
X-Unit test is a special test created for PL/SQL procedures.

The unit test is a package with some conventions:

a) Must start with prefix TEST_*
b) Must have a procedure init
c) Must have a procedure teardown
d) Must have one or more procedures check_*

Check procedures must be independent from each other.
Each test unit pass if all check procedures pass and fail otherwise.
If one check fail, test does not strop and continue to next check.
The order of execution of check procedure is random.

Run a test case
---------------
The test case can be run using the package: XUNIT.RUN(<package_name>)
To run all installed test case you can run XUNIT.RUN() with no parameters.
The procedure RUN return a result 0 if pass and > 1 if it fails.


Writing a test case
-------------------
There is a sample package provided as an example: TEST_SAMPLE
Procedures init, teardown and check* do not have parameters.

Procedure init will create the fixture data for all the tests in a test unit.
Procedure teardown will remove the fixture data.

Procedure check, must use xunit.assert() procedure to report the errors.
You must use assert at least once in each check procedure.

The check procedure is very easy to create:

Example.
----------------------------------------------------
procedure check_my_check is;
   dummy integer;
begin
   select count(*) into dummy from dual; 	  
   assert(dummy=1,'Wrong number of records in table dual, expected 1 found '||dummy);
end;
----------------------------------------------------

To use this kind of test, you must install XUNIT utility package.
